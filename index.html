        My name is Elda Paja. I am Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department at ITU since February 2021. I am affiliated with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/organisations/software-engineering(ee5c661f-e0ab-4afb-acba-6ec467d5f1a9).html">Software Engineering Group</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cisat.dk/">Center for Information Security and Trust</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am currently co-PI, together with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://okskulyk.github.io/">Oksana Kulyk</a>, of the aDESSO project, funded by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://digitallead.dk/">Digital Lead</a>, investigating how Danish Software Development SMEs involved in a B2B model demonstrate the security of their products and services.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p class="secsubhead">   My research background is in security requirements engineering, the design of modelling language and automated reasoning techniques to support strategic decision making. In my research I've explored the design of socio-technical systems from different angles: security, trust, risk, and decision-making support. 

    I have devised <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sts-tool.eu/">software tools</a> that assist requirements analysts and stakeholders in eliciting, expressing and analyzing requirements. 
    </p>


    <p>
    More recently, my research interests encompass the investigation of human factors in security, as well as security integration in agile software development. In this line of research, I have previously (up until Dec 2020) been part of the ASCD project, funded by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx">Danish Center for Cybersecurity</a>, investigating cybersecurity and privacy practices in Danish companies.  <br>

    Currently, together with my research assistant, Dahlia Andreasen, we are investigating the status of security integration in agile software developement in Danish software development companies. We have interviewed more than 30 participants from different companies, across different roles, including developers, product owners, and security experts. <br>

<h3>Service</h3>
    <p>  
    I am <b>Associate Editor</b> for the Data and Knowledge Engineering Journal. <br>
    I regularly serve as a reviewer for TOSEM, TSE, SoSYM, and serve on the program committee of international conferences such as RE, REFSQ, ER, RCIS. I was workshops co-chair for RE2023, co-chair for REFSQ’2021 Posters and Demos. <br> 
    An initiative I am particularly fond of, is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wsrecares.wixsite.com/recares2023">RE-Cares</a>, Requirements Engineering for social good, giving back to society. I am part of the organizing team since 2020. <br>
