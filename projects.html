            <p>
                The project aDESSO (Towards Demonstrating Secure Software Development for Small and Medium Enterprises in a Business-to-Business Model) is a research project conducted by the <a href="https://www.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> in collaboration with two consultancy companies, namely <a href="https://cyberjuice.io">Cyberjuice</a> and <a href="https://www.securityscientist.net">Security Scientist</a>, and it is funded by  <a href="https://https://digitallead.dk">Digital Lead</a>.

                The project aims to study and report on the needs, challenges but also capabilities of SMEs in demonstrating security to their potential customers in a B2B environment; we intend to identify a set of requirements that will serve as a basis to initially provide a set of recommendations, which we will test with the help of the participating companies. In the future, these requirements will inform the development of a framework for SMEs to demonstrate security.

            <p>
                The Assessment on the Status of CyberSecurity in Denmark (ASCD - pronounced as ‘asked’) is a research project conducted by the <a href="https://www.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the <a href="https://www.sdu.dk/da/om_sdu/institutter_centre/imada_matematik_og_datalogi">University of Southern Denmark</a> and funded by the <a href="https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx">Danish Centre for CyberSecurity</a>.

                The project aims to study and report on the existing cybersecurity and privacy protection practices used in large Danish companies and SMEs, identifying the most important challenges the developers in Denmark face in developing secure and privacy-preserving solutions, and providing guidelines for securing critical infrastructures.

            <p>
                PACAS is a H2020 Sesar funded project that will deliver a Change Management Platform, which will facilitate understanding, modelling and analyzing changes in the ATM System at different layers of abstraction. To achieve this aim, PACAS will rely on the end-to-end inclusion of ATM domain stakeholders by conceiving a novel participatory design process to handle change management. The process will rely on the provision of multiple views (to accommodate the expertise of the various domain stakeholders), as well as the representation and analysis of multiple objectives, such as those related to economical, organizational, security, and safety concerns.
